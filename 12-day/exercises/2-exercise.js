/*

  Create a function getUserSummary that takes a user object as a parameter. 
  This object will have firstName, lastName, and age properties.
  Use object destructuring to extract these properties.
  If age is not provided, it should default to 25. 
  The function should return a string in the format: "User: [First Name] [Last Name], Age: [Age]".
